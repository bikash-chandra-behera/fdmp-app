As a market researcher, I can provide you with an outline of the features and functionalities that would be essential for developing an industrial store management application. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **User Management:**
   - Registration and authentication system for employees, managers, and store managers.
   - Role-based access control to manage permissions and access levels.

2. **Item Inventory:**
   - A database to store the list of items available in the store.
   - Each item should have details like item name, code, description, quantity, location, etc.
   - Ability to add, edit, and delete items from the inventory.

3. **Issue Record:**
   - Functionality for employees to raise issue requests when they need items from the store.
   - Record issuer and receiver details for each issue request.
   - Status tracking of the issue request (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).

4. **Approval Workflow:**
   - Store managers should receive notifications of new issue requests for approval.
   - Ability for store managers to approve or reject issue requests.
   - Notification to employees regarding the approval status.

5. **Reports and Analytics:**
   - Generate reports on item usage, popular items, historical issue trends, etc.
   - Stock level reports to track inventory levels and identify low-stock items.
   - Reporting to help with decision-making and optimizing the store's operations.

6. **Notifications:**
   - Real-time notifications for various actions, such as item restocking, request approval, etc.
   - Email or in-app notifications to keep all users updated.

7. **Search and Filters:**

10. **Offline Support:**
    - Allow employees to work with the app even without an internet connection and sync data once online.

11. **Backup and Restore:**
    - Regular data backups to prevent data loss and the ability to restore data if needed.

Remember, as a market researcher, my role is to suggest the features based on the information provided. The actual development and implementation of the application would require a team of skilled developers and thorough testing to ensure the application meets the specific needs of the industrial store.
